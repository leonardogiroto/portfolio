      Loft&apos;s Frontend Interviews Process Revamp.<br /><br />
      Wrote a RFC and was responsible for a new process for the company&apos;s Frontend interviews. Proposed a new coding challenge and improvements to the way used to evaluate candidates; regarding evaluated topics, used tools and interview conduction, based on internal and external feedbacks. 
      <br /><br />
      The goals were to address known issues and have more cohesive evaluations from different engineers taking part in the recruting process, as well as providing trainings for them.
      <br /><br />
      Great feedback from our engineers interviewing and people being interviewed made us sure the keep the new process rolling, which is still being currently used.
