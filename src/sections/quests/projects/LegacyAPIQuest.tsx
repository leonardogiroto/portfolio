      Legacy API shutdown and birth of new solutions.<br /><br />
      As the team owner of the most legacy API project in the company, with a lot of issues and used by many different engineering teams and steakholders, we had the challenge to shut it down and provide alternative solutions for it.<br /><br />
      A hard task that involved talking to a lot of engineers and steakholders from other teams to understand their needs and creation of a serverless architecture that would be easier to scalate and flexible enough for the different usage scenarios.<br /><br />
      We achieved much better performance in API usages, created a much easier to maintain solution and had great reduction in its costs.<br /><br />
